<sup>1</sup>This is about my childhood, from the time I can barely remember. <sup>2</sup>When I was a child, it was still a time when we played outside, enjoying different physical games like <i>taya-tayaan</i>, <i>patintero</i>, or <i>langit lupa</i>. <sup>3</sup>I played with my neighbors back then, and I wouldn't even notice that night had already fallen—until my parents called me to go home. <sup>4</sup>Most of the time, I played running games like <i>taya-tayaan</i> or <i>langit lupa</i>, and it would go on until night. <sup>5</sup>I remember an abandoned car in our area, and we used to climb on it while playing <i>langit lupa</i>. <sup>6</sup>Because of those intense games, I often got injured. <sup>7</sup>My knees were constantly scraped, and one time, I even hurt my head when I tripped and fell. <sup>8</sup>I was so hyper back then that whenever I saw an opportunity, I would just run for no reason at all. <sup>9</sup>Before I started school, my days were filled with nothing but play. <sup>10</sup>I didn't know what boredom was—every day was fun. <sup>11</sup>But when school started, I realized I didn’t really like studying. <sup>12</sup>I only looked forward to recess and lunch, so I could play with my classmates. <sup>13</sup>Of course, I studied a little, but my knowledge was lacking. <sup>14</sup>I remember that when I entered second grade, I didn’t even know what the word <i><strong>name</strong></i> meant. <sup>15</sup>When we were asked to write our names in a book, I copied my seatmate’s answer, so instead of writing my own name, I wrote his. <sup>16</sup>That pretty much sums up my elementary days—I didn't listen to my teachers; I just wanted to play. <sup>17</sup>I wasn’t the kind of kid who wasn’t scared of teachers, though. <sup>18</sup>I still feared getting scolded. <sup>19</sup>But I remember some of my classmates would curse at teachers just for fun. <sup>20</sup>School was hectic back then. <sup>21</sup>Even if you wanted to listen to the lecture, you couldn’t because your seatmates or the people behind you would keep pestering you. <sup>22</sup>Bullying was also common. <sup>23</sup>If you didn’t want to be bullied, you had to stand your ground. <sup>24</sup>It was so common in elementary school that I often got into fights because of it. <sup>25</sup>You had no choice but to fight back, honestly. <sup>26</sup>If you told your teacher about it, they would ignore it, and your bullies would pester you even more. <sup>27</sup>But if you fought back, they would hesitate next time because they knew you weren’t a pushover. <sup>28</sup>Even though the environment was harsh and fistfights were common, I still find those times memorable for some reason. <sup>29</sup>After a while, playing outside wasn’t a thing for me anymore because our dad bought a PSP. <sup>30</sup>I got addicted to that gadget, so when I was home or during summer, I would play it all day. <sup>31</sup>At that time, we only had one PSP, so I had to share it with my brother, and sometimes we fought over who should play. <sup>32</sup>I think that’s the reason why I enjoy playing video games today. <sup>33</sup>That was also the time when watching movies on CDs was popular. <sup>34</sup>It was like a family bonding activity for us—we would borrow each other's CDs after finishing a movie to save money.

<sup>1</sup>About my teenage years, this is the time that I become more conscious of my actions. <sup>2</sup>I somehow become the shy type at this time compared to when I was much younger that I didn't care about other people. <sup>3</sup>I become more studious at this point, and the people are much more mature, so being in a fight is rare. <sup>4</sup>I fought someone at school, but just one time, because he kept pestering me every day. <sup>5</sup>Like, he was at my back, and my bag was on the chair. <sup>6</sup>After the classes were finished, I would notice that my bag had writings on it, and it also had boogers. <sup>7</sup>I disregarded it for a few weeks and didn't do anything about it, but at some point, I just had enough. <sup>8</sup>So, I waited for the classes to end and then pushed him suddenly, so we fist-fought until our classmates broke up the fight. <sup>9</sup>Nothing serious happened after that, it's just that he stopped pestering me. <sup>10</sup>Also, I got fascinated by the drummers in my school, so I joined the band to be a drummer. <sup>11</sup>It's fun during practice, especially during the parade, where we have to drum nonstop until we get calluses on our hands. <sup>12</sup>Unfortunately, sometimes the weather was bad, so we would only parade inside the school. <sup>13</sup>I think that's the only extracurricular activity I did at that time, but it was fun. <sup>14</sup>Also, in our school, there were a lot of events, so I joined many of them. <sup>15</sup>There were some events where we had to dance, so we had to practice for it. <sup>16</sup>We practiced after classes, either in the barangay or at someone else's house. <sup>17</sup>Fortunately, we won a lot of competitions because of our efforts, although it was tiring since we had to walk a lot during practices, and we would finish late at night. <sup>18</sup>During my high school days, we were always busy with projects and events, but whenever I had time, I would hang out with my friends. <sup>19</sup>I remember our hangout place, which was the house of a friend. <sup>20</sup>We just walked to get there, even though it was far from school. <sup>21</sup>If we had group activities or events, we would go there to practice. <sup>22</sup>We also played there and watched movies together—it was our tambayan when we had nothing else to do. <sup>23</sup>Of course, there were challenges in my teenage years, like anxiety, but I was able to manage it and get through it. <sup>24</sup>I remember that during recitations, I couldn't say a thing—my mind would go blank because I was so nervous. <sup>25</sup>It was always like that; I would just sit there, not saying anything. <sup>26</sup>That was the hardest thing for me, so I was really scared whenever there was a recitation or reporting. <sup>27</sup>I would worry about it even a week before the report, so I really hated it at that time. <sup>28</sup>Additionally, this was the time that I got addicted to video games. <sup>29</sup>I spent my time playing Mobile Legends, both at school and during my free time at home. <sup>30</sup>That's why I became so good at it, and I played against students from other sections and mostly won. <sup>31</sup>It was memorable; we always played together during recess and lunch. <sup>32</sup>Our internet connection was slow at school, but one of our classmates had a good connection, so we connected to his hotspot. <sup>33</sup>We would just play during our free time, either together or against each other, and we would tease each other while playing. <sup>34</sup>But unfortunately, the pandemic came, and classes were suspended. <sup>35</sup>We didn't get to graduate on-site because of the lockdown. <sup>36</sup>It was sad that we didn't get to say goodbye in person, but that's just how it is, I guess.

<sup>1</sup>During my college days, this is the time that I really go out of my comfort zone. <sup>2</sup>During my high school days, I had a friend that I always went with, and I always relied on him, so it was really hard starting college alone. <sup>3</sup>I actually had the choice of going with him, but I thought to myself that this was the time to be independent, to go out of my comfort zone. <sup>4</sup>So, the first day of college came, and we had to introduce ourselves. <sup>5</sup>For some reason, I was so nervous to introduce myself, but I did it. <sup>6</sup>I'm still adjusting to my new environment. <sup>7</sup>I still didn't know anyone from my class, but after a while, I met my circle. <sup>8</sup>College is still hard, but somehow not as hard as it was in senior high. <sup>9</sup>In senior high, we had piles of schoolwork, but now in college, it's more manageable. <sup>10</sup>But of course, it's still hard, and I still have to work hard to get a passing score from quizzes or exams. <sup>11</sup>I always liked to cram, so I would review for it the day before, during my commute hours. <sup>12</sup>In my first year of college, the new normal was implemented, so online classes were rare, and we really had to go to the campus. <sup>13</sup>Unfortunately, my home is really far from school, so it would take 2 hours to commute, which made it really hard to adjust. <sup>14</sup>Especially when there was traffic, it would take almost 3 hours, so I would be late for class. <sup>15</sup>I had to wake up early because of that, and I would get home late. <sup>16</sup>Sometimes I had to do homework, so I had no energy left to do anything else, and I would just sleep. <sup>17</sup>At first, it was hard, but I got used to it. <sup>18</sup>Luckily, I enjoyed commuting. <sup>19</sup>I enjoyed it while listening to music and getting lost in thought. <sup>20</sup>Sometimes, I would just sleep on the bus since it was really far, and for some reason, I never missed my destination. <sup>21</sup>The only thing I didn't like was when there were no seats left, so I had to stand during those 2 hours. <sup>22</sup>And the conductor would literally put a lot of people on the bus, so it was hard to stand, like there was no space left. <sup>23</sup>We also sometimes had long breaks, so we either ate outside or stayed in the library. <sup>24</sup>The library became our tambayan when we didn't have anything to do. <sup>25</sup>It was always the place where we had to review. <sup>26</sup>When I was sleepy, I just went there and slept. <sup>27</sup>I went to the 2nd floor instead of another floor because it was quieter there. <sup>28</sup>When I compare myself to when I was in high school or senior high, I think I've improved. <sup>29</sup>I'm forced to go out of my comfort zone, not being with the friend I was comfortable with, and I've grown as a person. <sup>30</sup>Now, I can do things I couldn't in the past. <sup>31</sup>So, I'm glad that I parted ways with that friend.
